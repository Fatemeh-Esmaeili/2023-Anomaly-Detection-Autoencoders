Anomaly Detection for Sensor Signals Utilizing Deep Learning Autoencoder-Based Neural Networks

Link: https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10040405

Function "confusion.m" computes the confusion matrix for generating the confusion charts.

Scripts "s1dataLabellingTrain" and "s2dataLabellingTest" generate the labels according to the signals' concentration.

The rest of the files are the deep learning networks with autoencoder-based architectures, then training the nets, defining the KDE threshold for distinguishing the normal data from the anomalies, and testing the models.
